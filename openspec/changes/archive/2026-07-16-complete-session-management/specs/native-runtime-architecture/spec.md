## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Guarded Git project operations
The native runtime SHALL perform Git project inspection and worktree creation through backend-owned command construction and validated filesystem paths.

#### Scenario: Inspect repository with explicit Git command
- **WHEN** the native runtime inspects whether a selected folder is a Git repository
- **THEN** it SHALL construct the Git process invocation with explicit executable and argument values and SHALL NOT rely on shell string interpolation

#### Scenario: Create worktree with explicit Git command
- **WHEN** the native runtime creates a Git worktree
- **THEN** it SHALL execute `git worktree add` through explicit executable and argument values derived from validated backend-owned metadata

#### Scenario: Reject unsafe worktree name
- **WHEN** a worktree name contains path separators, `..`, control characters, or normalizes to an empty segment
- **THEN** the native runtime SHALL reject the request before executing a Git command

#### Scenario: Keep worktree outside project path
- **WHEN** a worktree target path is resolved
- **THEN** the native runtime SHALL reject the target if it is inside the selected project path

#### Scenario: Log Git diagnostics
- **WHEN** Git inspection or worktree creation fails with command output
- **THEN** the native runtime SHALL write redacted stdout, stderr, and diagnostics through the unified logging service

### Requirement: Native project persistence
The native runtime SHALL persist known project history and session project/worktree metadata in SQLite through additive migrations.

#### Scenario: Migrate known project history
- **WHEN** the native runtime initializes an empty or older database
- **THEN** it SHALL apply a migration that creates storage for known project path, display name, Git status, and last opened timestamp

#### Scenario: Migrate optional session project metadata
- **WHEN** the native runtime initializes an empty or older database
- **THEN** it SHALL apply a migration that adds optional selected project path, worktree path, worktree name, and worktree branch metadata to session storage

#### Scenario: Load older sessions
- **WHEN** an existing session has no project/worktree metadata
- **THEN** the native runtime SHALL return the session with null project/worktree metadata and its existing effective folder value
