## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Nonblocking CLI command boundaries
The native runtime SHALL keep CLI refresh and CLI package Tauri command boundaries nonblocking by returning a backend-managed operation before external command work completes.

#### Scenario: Refresh command returns before detection completes
- **WHEN** the frontend requests CLI detection refresh
- **THEN** the Tauri command SHALL return a stable operation id without waiting for executable probing or npm registry commands
- **AND** timeout failures from background detection SHALL be recorded on the operation and in unified logs rather than surfacing as a Tauri command timeout

#### Scenario: Package command returns before npm completes
- **WHEN** the frontend requests CLI install, upgrade, or downgrade for a valid managed CLI and stable target version
- **THEN** the Tauri command SHALL return a stable operation id without waiting for npm install to complete
- **AND** timeout failures from the npm process SHALL be recorded on the operation and in unified logs rather than surfacing as a Tauri command timeout

### Requirement: Managed CLI package operation parity
The native runtime SHALL use one backend-owned package operation implementation for Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI.

#### Scenario: Resolve package metadata from catalog
- **WHEN** a CLI package operation starts for a managed CLI agent id
- **THEN** the native runtime SHALL resolve package name, display name, executable name, and provider from the backend CLI catalog
- **AND** it SHALL construct npm with explicit executable and argument values equivalent to `npm install -g <package>@<targetVersion>`

#### Scenario: Refresh affected CLI after package success
- **WHEN** a CLI package operation succeeds
- **THEN** the native runtime SHALL refresh and persist the affected CLI status
- **AND** the persisted status SHALL include the operation id that performed the package operation
