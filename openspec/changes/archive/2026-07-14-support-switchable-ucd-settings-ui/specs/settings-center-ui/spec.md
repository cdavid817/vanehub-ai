## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Settings center shell
The system SHALL render a UCD-aligned settings center as the primary frontend surface with top navigation, settings sidebar navigation, and a page content area.

#### Scenario: Render settings center
- **WHEN** a user opens the VaneHub AI frontend in the Tauri desktop runtime or browser Web runtime
- **THEN** the system SHALL show the settings center shell with VaneHub AI branding, settings navigation, and a selected settings page

#### Scenario: Navigate settings pages
- **WHEN** a user selects a settings navigation item
- **THEN** the system SHALL update the active page content and active navigation state without requiring a runtime-specific backend call

### Requirement: UCD settings pages
The system SHALL provide settings pages for basic configuration, provider management, SDK dependencies, MCP servers, agents, and skills.

#### Scenario: Display UCD page set
- **WHEN** the settings center navigation is rendered
- **THEN** the system SHALL include entries for basic configuration, provider management, SDK dependencies, MCP servers, agents, and skills

#### Scenario: Display pages without backend services
- **WHEN** a user opens a settings page that does not yet have a dedicated frontend service boundary
- **THEN** the system SHALL render that page using frontend-local data without calling Tauri commands directly from React components

### Requirement: Switchable UCD visual styles
The system SHALL support switching between the `futuristic` and `minimal` UCD visual styles through a shared theme mechanism.

#### Scenario: Switch visual style
- **WHEN** a user selects a different UCD visual style
- **THEN** the system SHALL update the settings center appearance while preserving the current active settings page and page state

#### Scenario: Apply style consistently
- **WHEN** a UCD visual style is active
- **THEN** the system SHALL apply that style consistently to the top navigation, sidebar, content panels, controls, badges, and detail areas through semantic design tokens

### Requirement: Extensible style registration
The system SHALL register visual styles through a central frontend registry so future styles can be added without modifying page-specific business logic.

#### Scenario: Registered styles populate switcher
- **WHEN** the style switcher is rendered
- **THEN** the system SHALL derive available style options from the central style registry

#### Scenario: Future style addition
- **WHEN** a developer adds a new registered style and matching semantic token definitions
- **THEN** the system SHALL make that style available without requiring conditional style branches inside each settings page component

### Requirement: Style persistence
The system SHALL persist the selected UCD visual style in frontend-local storage for both browser Web and Tauri desktop runtimes.

#### Scenario: Restore selected style
- **WHEN** a user selects a UCD visual style and later reopens the frontend
- **THEN** the system SHALL restore the last valid selected style

#### Scenario: Invalid persisted style
- **WHEN** the persisted style value does not match a registered style
- **THEN** the system SHALL fall back to the default registered style
