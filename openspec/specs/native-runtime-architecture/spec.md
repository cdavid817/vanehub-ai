# native-runtime-architecture Specification

## Purpose
Defines the native runtime foundation for app-owned storage, migrations, structured diagnostics, long-running tasks, command safety, and Tauri desktop security.
## Requirements
### Requirement: App-owned storage paths
The native runtime SHALL store application data in VaneHub-owned user data directories resolved through runtime-safe path APIs rather than relying on the process current working directory.

#### Scenario: Open desktop database
- **WHEN** the Tauri desktop runtime initializes local storage
- **THEN** it SHALL resolve the SQLite database path under an app-owned VaneHub user data directory

#### Scenario: Preserve project scope identity
- **WHEN** project-scoped data such as MCP servers is persisted
- **THEN** the native runtime SHALL store an explicit canonical project path for scope matching without using the database location as the project identity

### Requirement: Versioned SQLite migrations
The native runtime SHALL apply versioned SQLite migrations for schema creation and upgrades.

#### Scenario: Empty database startup
- **WHEN** the native runtime opens an empty database
- **THEN** it SHALL apply all required migrations in order before serving commands

#### Scenario: Existing database upgrade
- **WHEN** the native runtime opens an existing database with an older schema version
- **THEN** it SHALL apply pending migrations in order and report migration failures as structured startup errors

### Requirement: Structured native errors and logging
The native runtime SHALL use structured errors and logs for database, storage, command execution, network, validation, and task failures.

#### Scenario: Command failure
- **WHEN** a Tauri command fails
- **THEN** the native runtime SHALL return a user-displayable structured error and record a diagnostic log entry

#### Scenario: Native task diagnostic
- **WHEN** a long-running operation changes state or emits output
- **THEN** the native runtime SHALL record or emit structured task logs associated with that operation

### Requirement: Long-running native task registry
The native runtime SHALL represent long-running SDK, MCP, and Agent operations as tasks when they can exceed a short immediate command response.

#### Scenario: Start task
- **WHEN** the frontend starts a long-running native operation
- **THEN** the native runtime SHALL return a stable task id and expose task status through a service boundary

#### Scenario: Complete task
- **WHEN** a long-running native operation completes or fails
- **THEN** the native runtime SHALL expose final status, result or error, timestamps, and available logs for that task

### Requirement: Guarded external command execution
The native runtime SHALL execute external commands only through backend-owned command construction or validated user configuration without shell string interpolation.

#### Scenario: Backend-owned command
- **WHEN** the native runtime launches a known Agent or SDK command from backend-owned metadata
- **THEN** it SHALL construct the process invocation with explicit executable and argument values

#### Scenario: User-configured command
- **WHEN** the native runtime runs a user-configured MCP command
- **THEN** it SHALL validate the command configuration, avoid shell string interpolation, and record an audit log entry for the execution attempt

### Requirement: Desktop security baseline
The Tauri desktop runtime SHALL define explicit security settings for content security policy, native capabilities, and privileged runtime operations.

#### Scenario: Render packaged app
- **WHEN** the packaged desktop app loads frontend assets
- **THEN** it SHALL use an explicit CSP compatible with the app's required local functionality

#### Scenario: Privileged operation
- **WHEN** the frontend requests a privileged local operation
- **THEN** the native runtime SHALL route that request through a declared Tauri command and service adapter rather than exposing unrestricted native APIs to React components

### Requirement: SQLite-backed common settings
The native runtime SHALL persist common application settings in app-owned SQLite storage using a versioned migration.

#### Scenario: Create settings table
- **WHEN** the native runtime initializes an empty or older application database
- **THEN** it SHALL apply a migration that creates a key-value settings table before serving settings commands

#### Scenario: Load settings command
- **WHEN** the frontend requests common settings in the Tauri desktop runtime
- **THEN** the native runtime SHALL return persisted settings merged with valid default values

#### Scenario: Save setting command
- **WHEN** the frontend saves one common setting in the Tauri desktop runtime
- **THEN** the native runtime SHALL validate and upsert that setting in the SQLite settings table

### Requirement: Native Node.js environment inspection
The native runtime SHALL expose Node.js executable path and version information through a declared Tauri command.

#### Scenario: Resolve Node.js information
- **WHEN** the frontend requests Node.js environment information
- **THEN** the native runtime SHALL attempt to resolve the Node.js executable path and version without starting an interactive session

#### Scenario: Return unavailable Node.js information
- **WHEN** Node.js cannot be resolved
- **THEN** the native runtime SHALL return a user-displayable unavailable result rather than failing settings page rendering
